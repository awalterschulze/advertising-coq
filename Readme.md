# Advertising Coq: Proving is Programming

This repo contains the code, notes and other resources for a presentation that advertises the Coq programming language:

The slides:
  - Are shared here: https://slides.com/walterschulze/advertising-coq
  - They contain all the speech as text
  - They also contain links to the code that is shared here, which also contain the speech during the demo as comments

Creating these slides included watching a few videos and a brainstorming session, during which notes were taken, see [Notes](./Notes.md)

The code:
  1. [deMorgenBool.v](./deMorgenBool.v)
  2. [Sum.v](./Sum.v)
  3. [CurryHoward.v](./CurryHoward.v)
  4. [Book.v](./Book.v)
  5. [deMorgenProp.v](./deMorgenProp.v) (optional)
